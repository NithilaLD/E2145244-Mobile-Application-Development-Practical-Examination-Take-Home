Weather Cast Mobile App

This Android app provides real-time weather information based on the user's current location as well as for a given city. The main screen of the app displays the current latitude and longitude, the reverse geo-coded address of the location, the current system time, and the weather information (including temperature, humidity, and weather description). The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and handles network operations asynchronously. JSON responses from the API are parsed to extract the required weather information.
